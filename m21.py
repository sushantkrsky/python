#set- set is used for store but only unique not duplicate
# []- list
# ()- tuple, but here bracket is not compulsary
# {}- set
# in set index does not exit(we cant find exact place of number or name)
marks={95,98,97,97,97}
print(marks)
# for index we use for loop
for score in marks:
    print(score)

# set is unordered because index is not here
# order means fix sequence
